## What Lovable manages

Rules outside this block are the project's own. Change the pieces below in
Lovable, not by hand. With the [Lovable MCP](https://mcp.lovable.dev)
connected, `send_message` asks Lovable to do it; otherwise ask the user to
use the editor.

- **Database.** Do not add or edit `supabase/migrations/` or `drizzle/`.
  Ask Lovable to change the schema.
- **Generated files.** Do not edit a file whose header says it is automatically
  generated.
- **AI gateway.** Keep model calls on Lovable's gateway, and keep
  `LOVABLE_API_KEY` out of browser code.
- **Connectors.** Lovable provides native connectors. `list_connectors` shows
  which are enabled; `add_connector` only returns the dashboard link. When a
  connector is enabled, calls go through the connector gateway and need
  `LOVABLE_API_KEY`. When Lovable does not provide one, users can bring their
  own key and store it in Secrets.
- **Secrets.** Lovable manages them. Do not put secret values in the repo.

## App structure

- Keep AgriSathi as a single TanStack home route with client-side view selection for its three primary experiences; keep crop-monitoring data and browser-only helpers in focused `src/lib` modules so offline interactions remain local.
- Generate the offline service worker through `vite-plugin-pwa` and register it only through the guarded `src/lib/pwa-registration.ts` wrapper, so previews stay isolated and published builds can work offline.
- Keep the app shell constrained to the visual viewport with a continuous min-height-zero flex chain; chat scrolls only in its transcript and other views own their scroll areas, so the composer remains visible on phones and with the keyboard open.
